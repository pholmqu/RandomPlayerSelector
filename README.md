Description:	This project was built using Python and Tkinter. This project resulted in an application that had two focuses.
		The first focus was on making an application that could act as a random player selecter. The second focus was
		on learning more about Tkinter to make a GUI based application instead of a terminal based application.

		- Displays each player that was provided by User
		- Using Tkinter, allows User ability to change canvas color
		- Using Tkinter, allows User ability to change frame color
		- Using Tkinter, allows User ability to reset canvas and frame color to default
		- Assigns each Player in list a unique random number that is [1, # of Players]
		- Randomly "Roll" to select a player by using random number generator and comparing to assigned numbers
		- Using Tkinter, save list of players to a file for future use
		- Using Tkinter, load list of players from a file
		- Clear list of players
		- "Roll" protection by not allowing User to roll if a unique number greater than 0 is not assigned.
		- Remove player that was most recently added to list
